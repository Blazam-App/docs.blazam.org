# Notifications
Blazam offers a flexible notification system for both in-app and email notifications.

## Requirements
In order for email notifications to go out, email must be enabled in `Configure -> Settings`.

## Behavior
Notification settings, much like permissions, are applied to OU's and propagate down the OU tree
unless a `Block` is placed at a lower level.

In-app and email notification types can be included/excluded together or independently.

## User Access
All users can manage their own notification settings via the `User Button` in the top right of Blazam.

## Admin Management
Super-admins can manage all other users notifications via the `Configure -> Notifications` feature.
