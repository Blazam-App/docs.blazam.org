# Automatic Updates

!!! warning

	Auto-update is now in Beta


To configure automatic updates, go to `Configure` -> `Settings` -> `Update` and enable auto updates.

You can then choose a time of day to perform the update. The default value is 2:00 local server time. Choose a time with minimal user activity to avoid disruptions.

When an update is release, Blazam will schedule a self update at the configured time.
