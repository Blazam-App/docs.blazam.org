# Self-Update

!!! warning

	Self-update is now in Beta.

Blazam can update itself regardless of how it is installed.

To update go to `Configure` -> `Settings` -> `Update`, if an update is available, an update button and release notes will be available.

During a self update Blazam backs up the current installation to `C:\Windows\temp\Blazam\backup\` or wherever your Windows temporary folder is configured.
