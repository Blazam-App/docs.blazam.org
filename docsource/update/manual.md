# Manual Update



!!! info 

	Blazam can update itself, but some configuration
	is required. Check the [self-update](self.md) page for more info.


Manual updating is very easy with Blazam

1. [Download the latest release](https://blazam.org/download)
1. Stop your Blazam instance via IIS or Services
1. Extract the contents of the release zip file to the application directory
1. Restart Blazam

All database updates are applied automatically when the application starts.
