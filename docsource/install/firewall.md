# Firewall

## User Access
Blazam listens for HTTP and HTTPS connections on whatever ports you configure during installation.

Forward these ports on firewalls that should allow access.

## System Communications
If you have a firewall between Blazam and the Active Directory domain controllers forward the port configured in settings within the app.
