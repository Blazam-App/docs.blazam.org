# Password Reset Settings

The password reset settings allow you to configure recovery options for your account. These settings are accessed through the user menu in the top right corner.

## Recovery Email
You must provide a valid email address to receive password reset links or codes.

## PIN
Setting a PIN adds an extra layer of security to the password reset process. If configured, you will be required to enter this PIN when attempting to reset your password.

## Security Questions
You can configure three security questions and answers. All questions and answers must be provided. These questions will be presented to you during the password recovery process to verify your identity.

!!! note
    These settings are only used for self-service password resets if enabled by your administrator.
